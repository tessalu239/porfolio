About Me

I am currently pursuing an advanced diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca Polytechnic, where I am developing a strong foundation in software development. 

With a passion for front-end web development, I have gained knowledge and experience in various programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, and TypeScript. Additionally, I am familiar with modern front-end frameworks and libraries like React.js, Vue.js, and Angular. I also work with tools such as Sass/SCSS and Bootstrap to enhance my web development projects. My goal is to create engaging, user-friendly web applications that offer seamless experiences while staying updated with the latest trends in web technologies.
