Hi, I'm Minh Thu Lu, a current student at Seneca Polytechnic, where I'm honing my skills in web development. 

For my portfolio project, I leveraged HTML/CSS alongside the Bootstrap framework to create a visually appealing and responsive website. This project not only showcases my proficiency in front-end technologies but also highlights my ability to design user-friendly interfaces. My approach focused on blending creativity with functionality, ensuring that the final product is both aesthetically pleasing and practical for end-users. I'm eager to bring these skills to real-world projects and further explore the dynamic field of web development.
